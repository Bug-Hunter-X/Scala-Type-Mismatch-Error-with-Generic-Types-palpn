This example demonstrates a common error in Scala when working with generics. The `MyClass` class defines a method `myMethod` that attempts to add two values of type `T`.  However, this will only work if the type `T` supports the `+` operator (e.g., Int, Double). If `T` is a type that does not support addition (e.g., String), a compile-time error will occur. The solution demonstrates how to solve this by explicitly requiring `T` to extend a numeric type.
